## Reason for the Selected Topic
Using machine learning model, we hope to create a way to predict crypto market data. We will assess and analyze historical data of fourteen most popular cryptocurrencies and compare the findings to real world market data.

## Description of Source Data
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/g-research-crypto-forecasting/data) The dataset contains historical trades on several cryptoassets such as Ethereum, Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Cardano and more.
- [G-Reaserch](https://www.gresearch.co.uk/) is a quantitative finance research firm in Europe. They utilized machine learning, big data and the most advanced technology to predict movements in the financial markets.

## Question we hope to answer with the data
- Which Machine Learning Model would best predict future price changes?
- By how much is cryptocurrency price going to increase in the near future compared to current price market?
- Which coin/assets would be more stable out of the six cryptocurrency chosen for this project?


## Machine Learning Model 
Taking in a set of factors, we are going to use different machine learning models to predict each cryptocurrency's returns. 
- Linear Regression:
	- Description of data preprocessing:
	- Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including the decision-making process:
	- Description of how data was split intro training and testing sets:
	- Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits:
		- Advantages: process very fast
		- Limitations: the accuracy of predictions are lower than other models
	- Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables):
	- Description of how they have trained the model thus far, and any additional training that will take place:
	- Description of current accuracy score
- XGBooster Model:
	- Description of data preprocessing:
	- Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including the decision-making process:
	- Description of how data was split intro training and testing sets:
	- Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits:
		- Advantages: process very fast
		- Limitations: the accuracy of predictions are lower than other models
	- Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables):
	- Description of how they have trained the model thus far, and any additional training that will take place:
	- Description of current accuracy score
- Random Forest:
	- Description of data preprocessing:
	- Description of feature engineering and the feature selection, including the decision-making process:
	- Description of how data was split intro training and testing sets:
	- Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits:
		- Advantages: This model is great for Classification and Regression tasks.
		- Limitations: The run-time performance of this model is very slow. Also, it cannot extrapolate and can only make a prediction that is an average of previously observed labels. 
	- Explanation of changes in model choice (if changes occurred between the Segment 2 and Segment 3 deliverables):
	- Description of how they have trained the model thus far, and any additional training that will take place:
	- Description of current accuracy score
