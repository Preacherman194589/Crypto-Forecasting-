## Reason for the Selected Topic
Using machine learning model, we hope to create a way to predict crypto market data. We will assess and analyze historical data of fourteen most popular cryptocurrencies and compare the findings to real world market data.

## Description of Source Data
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/g-research-crypto-forecasting/data) 
> The dataset contains historical trades on several cryptoassets such as Ethereum, Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Cardano and more.
- [G-Reaserch (Europeâ€™s leading quantitative finance research firm)](https://www.gresearch.co.uk/) is a quantitative finance research firm in Europe. They utilized machine learning, big data and the most advanced technology to predict movements in the financial markets.

## Question we hope to answer with the data

- Which among the fourteen popular assets will give the highest return?
- How much is it going to increase in one year from current price market?**
- Which coin/assets would be more stable?
- Which Machine Learning Model is best model for the dataset?
