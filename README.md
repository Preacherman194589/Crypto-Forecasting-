## Reason for the Selected Topic
Using machine learning model, we hope to create a way to predict crypto market data. We will assess and analyze historical data of fourteen most popular cryptocurrencies and compare the findings to real world market data.

## Description of Source Data
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/g-research-crypto-forecasting/data) The dataset contains historical trades on several cryptoassets such as Ethereum, Dogecoin, Bitcoin, Cardano and more.
- [G-Reaserch](https://www.gresearch.co.uk/) is a quantitative finance research firm in Europe. They utilized machine learning, big data and the most advanced technology to predict movements in the financial markets.

## Question we hope to answer with the data
- Which among the five popular assets will give the highest return? (Binance Coin, Bitcoin, EOS.io, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero)
- How much is it going to increase in the near future from current price market?
- Which coin/assets would be more stable?
- Which Machine Learning Model is best predict the dataset?

## Machine Learning Model 
Taking in a set of factors, we are going to use different machine learning models to predict each cryptocurrency's returns. 
- Linear Regression - to predict continuous variables<br/> 
        - Advantages: process very fast
	- Limitations: the accuracy of predictions are lower than other models
- XGBooster Model - to determine if best model to predict crypto market data
- Random Forest: 	
	- Advantages: 
	- Limitations: Random Forest cannot extrapolate and can only make a prediction that is an average of previously observed labels
